Implementation of common data structures in C for fun and profit.

The purpose of this repository is just to keep the knowledge of common data
structures fresh. I am very grateful if you send me comments or patches if you
see something that is noteworthy.

I am starting out with linked list.

Other stuff that I might take a look at is circular buffer, binary search and
binary tree.
