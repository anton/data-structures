Implementation of common data structures in C for fun and profit.

The purpose of this repository is just to keep the knowledge of common data
structures fresh. I am very grateful if you send me comments or patches if you
see something that is noteworthy.

I am starting out with linked list.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list

Other stuff that I might take a look at is circular buffer, binary search and
binary tree.

Time complexity compared for Linked List, Array and Dynamic Array:
				L.L.	Array   D.A.
Indexing			O(n)	O(1)	O(1)
Insertion/deletion at end	O(1)	N/A	O(1)
Insertion/deletion in middle    O(1)    N/A	O(n)
Wasted space (average)		O(n)    0	O(n)
